            Our approach to online education is holistic, and our base journey
            ensures learners are equipped with knowledge and skills to succeed.
            Some learners require additional support or challenge, and we
            provide these in our Journey 2 and Journey 3 packages. Irrespective
            of the package of choice, all learners receive access to our
            globally recognised curriculum, unique future technologies modules,
            and have opportunities to develop their critical thinking and
            mindsets.
