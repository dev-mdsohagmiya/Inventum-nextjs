        We take great pride at Inventum International in our online programmes,
        which are designed by our team of highly qualified and experienced
        international teachers. Our asynchronous learning platform, Canvas,
        offers learners access to their coursework, resources and assessments in
        real-time with the flexibility of allowing them to learn on their own
        schedule. To ensure Inventum learners have all the support they need, we
        offer a range of personalised services, including a dedicated study
        coach, cognitive ability tests, study plans, progression tests,
        career-advice and university application support. All learners interact
        within our safe and secure platforms, and can easily contact an academic
        tutor, who is available to support learners. Our platform also gives
        Inventum learners the opportunity to connect with and support each
        other, fostering a strong sense of community and mutual support.
